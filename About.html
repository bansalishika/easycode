    <p class="picture"> My name is Ishika Bansal. I am a Grade 10 student. I study in Pathways World School, Aravali. As a part of my personal project I was supposed to learn 2-3 programming languages and contribute to the betterment of society. According to me, learning coding is very important and can be learnt by anyone.  Learning programming is not ‘Rocket Science’ and is very easy if a person is dedicated towards it. In my perspective, it is something which a person should know. As I myself learnt coding, I would say that programming is just like maths, needs regular practice. </p>

    <p class="picture"> The website provides assistance to the people who wish to learn HTML, CSS and jQuery. It is especially for the people who think that learning coding is very difficult and do not find it easy to comprehend computer language.The website doesn't teach how to learn coding, helps a person to find some basic notes regarding HTML, CSS and jQuery. It also has some of the links which the user can refer to so as to learn how to code. </p>
    <p class="picture">You can refer this website without any problems or doubts because it is fully credible. The content is checked and approved befor uploading by an IIT graduate.</p>
